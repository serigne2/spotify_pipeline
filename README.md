# spotify_pipeline
My project consists of creating an automated system to extract and analyze my listening histories from my Spotify account. To do this, I have developed a Python program that connects to the Spotify API and retrieves my listening data. Then, I have set up a data transformation process to clean, format, and enrich the data using advanced data manipulation techniques with Python.

Once the data is transformed, I load it into a MySQL database for further management and analysis. I chose MySQL for its reliability, ease of use, and compatibility with the needs of my project. Using SQL allows me to easily query the data and extract valuable insights into my listening habits and musical preferences.

To automate this process, I integrated Apache Airflow, a powerful workflow management tool. Airflow allows me to schedule and automatically execute each step of the ETL process at regular intervals, ensuring regular updates to my listening data without manual intervention.

In summary, my project combines leveraging the Spotify API, advanced data processing with Python, using a MySQL database for data storage, and Apache Airflow for ETL process automation. This approach enables me to gain valuable insights into my listening habits and fully utilize my Spotify data.
